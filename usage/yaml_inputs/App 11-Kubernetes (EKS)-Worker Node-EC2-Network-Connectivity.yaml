# The following build out experiment building blocks. Need only set up once and update/change accordingly. 

# Package: # include if we are uploading a zip containing new modules/packages

# Experiment Method will hit the /method route. Must follow method_name: [func1, func2,...] pattern. Can provide a list
Scenario Method:

    - experimentvr.load.actions.load_generate
    - experimentvr.ec2.actions.stress_all_network_io

# # Method configurations will hit /scenario route.

# # Target application hits /target route. Takes up to 2 lists: target_config and steady state. 
# # Steady state sets steady state probes and follows identically to /method. 
# # Target config is similar to scenario, except it takes arg: val pairs directly as opposed to sorting by function. 
# # If steady state is set, be sure to include all the arg: val pairs needed to run the probes.
