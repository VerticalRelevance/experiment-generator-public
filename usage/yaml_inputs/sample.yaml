      experiment scenario: Blackhole DNS # Everything else
      target application: (EKS)-Worker Node-EC2  # App

# The following build out experiment building blocks. Need only set up once and update/change accordingly. 

# Package: # include if we are uploading a zip containing new modules/packages
#   - C:\Users\ShahRahman\Downloads\experimentvr.zip 

# Experiment Method will hit the /method route. Must follow method_name: [func1, func2,...] pattern. Can provide a list
Scenario Method:
  - Blackhole DNS:
    - experimentvr.load.actions.load_generate
    - experimentvr.network.actions.point_inactive_dns

# # Method configurations will hit /scenario route. 
Scenario Configurations: 
  - term: Blackhole DNS
    scenario:
      experimentvr.load.actions.load_generate:
        count: 1000
      experimentvr.network.actions.point_inactive_dns:
        test_target_type: RANDOM
        node_key: tag:Name
        node_values: placeholder.k8s.local

# Target application hits /target route. Takes up to 2 lists: target_config and steady state. 
# Steady state sets steady state probes and follows identically to /method. 
# Target config is similar to scenario, except it takes arg: val pairs directly as opposed to sorting by function. 
# If steady state is set, be sure to include all the arg: val pairs needed to run the probes.
